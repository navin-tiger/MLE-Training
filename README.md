# Median housing value prediction

The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data. 

The following techniques have been used: 

 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest

## Steps performed
 - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
 - Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
 - Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
 - All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.

## Create and environment using env.yml file 
1) create new environment using conda and activate it 
2) Run this command to get env.yml (conda env export>environment.yml)
2) Activate environment by this command (conda activate <env-name>)
 
## To excute the script
python < scriptname.py >
1) Install all libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn 
2) Run python script ( python nonstandardcode.py)
